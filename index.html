                Hello, I am Kenydee V. Garcia! I am a student taking BSCS in Silliman Univeristy, the reason why I took this course is because
                I am interested in technology and programming, and I hope to become a game developer one day! So far during my time here I have learned HTML, CSS, and C, and I hope to learn more in this course! Infact, I am currently applying my knowledge I gained from this course to make this website using HTML and CSS!
